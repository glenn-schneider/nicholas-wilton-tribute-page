        <h1>Here's a timeline of Nicholas Winton's life:</h1>

        <ul class="event">
          <li><b>1909 - </b> born in Hampstead, London</li>
          <li><b>1938 - </b> Winton travels to Czechoslovakia after being urged by a friend, Martin Blake, to see the effects of Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland. <br><br> In Prague, Blake introduced Winton to his colleague, Doreen Wariner, and arranged for him to visit refugee camps filled to capacity with Jews and political opponents from the Sudetenland.</li>
          <li><b>1939 - </b>Winton leaves Prague, six weeks before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Other foreign volunteers remained. <br><br> When he heard of subsequent efforts of Jewish agencies in Britain to rescue German and Austrian Jewish children , Winton summoned a small group of people to organize a similar rescue operation for children imperiled by the impending German dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.<br> <br>
          Winton returned to London to organize the rescue operation on that end. He raised money to fund the transports of the children and the 50 pound per child guarantee demanded by the British government to fund the children's eventual departure from Britain. He also had to find British families willing to care for the refugee children. <br><br>The first transport of children organized by Winton left Prague by plane for London on March 14, 1939, the day before the Germans occupied the Czech lands. Winton organized seven further transports. The last trainload of children left Prague on August 2, 1939. Rescue activities ceased when Germany invaded Poland and Britain declared war in Germany in early September 1939.<br><br>Following the outbreak of World War II, Winton declined to be conscripted into the British Army, applying successfully for registration as a conscientious objector, and later served with the Red Cross.
          <li><b>1940 - </b> Wilton rescinds his objections and joins the Royal Air Force, Administrative and Special Duties Branch. Initially he was an aircraftman, rising to sergeant over the years.</li>
          <li><b>1944 - </b>Wilton is promoted to pilot officer on probation.</li>
          <li><b>1945 - </b>Wilton is promoted to the rank of war substantive flying officer, staying in the Air Force after the war. 
          <li><b>1948 - </b>He meets Grete Gjelstrup, a Danish secretary and accountant's daughter. They married in her hometown of Vejle.
          <li><b>1950 - </b>Winton and his brother Robert start an inter-regional fencing competition in 1950. The Winton Cup continues to this day.</li>
          <li><b>1954 - </b> He relinquishes his commission, retaining the honorary rank of flight lieutenant. Winton mentions his humanitarian accomplishments in his election material while unsuccessfully standing for election to the Maidenhead town council. Otherwise, he goes unnoticed.</li>
          <li><b>1988 - </b>His wife finds a detailed scrapbook in their attic, containing lists of the children, including their parents' names and the names and addresses of the families that took them in. <br><br>She gives the scrapbook to Elisabeth Maxwell, a Holocaust researcher and wife of media magnate Robert Maxwell. Letters were sent to each of these known addresses and 80 of "Winton's children" were found in Britain.<br><br>The wider world finds out about his work during an episode of the BBC television programme That's Life! when he is as a member of the audience. At one point, Winton's scrapbook is shown and his achievements are explained. <br><br>The host of the programme, Esther Rantzen, asks whether anybody in the audience was among the children who owed their lives to Winton, and if so, to stand: more than two dozen people surrounding Winton rise and applaud. Rantzen then asks if anyone present was the child or grandchild of one of the children Winton saved, and the rest of the audience stands up.</li>
       <li><b>2003 - </b>He is knighted for services to humanity, in recognition of his work on the Czech Kindertransport. He also recieves the Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement.
       <li><b>2008 - </b>He is honoured by the Czech government in several ways. An elementary school in Kunžak is named after him, and he is awarded the Cross of Merit of the Minister of Defence, Grade I. The Czech government nominates him for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.
       <li><b>2010 - </b>Winton is named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.
       <li><b>2014 - </b>On Winton's 105th birthday, it is announced he was to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, for giving Czech children "the greatest possible gift: the chance to live and to be free".<br><br>Winton is awarded the Order of the White Lion (Class I) by Czech President Miloš Zeman, the Czech Defence Ministry having sent a special aircraft to bring him to Prague.
      <li><b>2015 - </b> Winton dies in his sleep at age 106
